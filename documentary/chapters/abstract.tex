The following documentation will focus on the principles of parallel programming in general and the mathematical background. In addition to the different parallel programming architectures, the various models for their implementation are also discussed. Moreover, in this thesis the prerequisites for mathematical calculation models, which are suitable for Parallel Programming, are elaborated.\newline\newline
For a practical example, the ESP32 microcontroller was chosen, an embedded multicore system. After a brief introduction to the hardware itself, further details of the project structure and the development of the application will be presented. Therefore, a short example will be explained to focus on the basics of parallel programming.\newline\newline
Finally, the aim of the project and the documentation is an automatic benchmark setup and a webfrontend result overview for visualization purposes, which will be discussed in more detail in the conclusion.
